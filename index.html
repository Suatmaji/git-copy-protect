With the coming of CDs, the manual look-up protection has waned as a means of preventing piracy. Instead, many software companies are trying to prevent users from being able to copy CDs containing the software. Some even go as far as preventing the game from being able to run unless the CD is in the CD drive. <br>
<br>
The following are some of the means used to prevent CD copying: <br>
<br>
<b>Oversized CDs</b>: Some companies print CDs which contain slightly more data than regular CD-Rs can hold. Copying such a CD onto a regular CD-R is impossible. However, bigger-capacity CD-Rs are now available that can hold as much information as any mass-produced CD. In addition, many companies boost the size of the CD by blatantly including software that is unnecessary to the product being sold. For example, some game manufacturers have put Netscape Navigator onto their CDs. This gives pirates an easy opportunity to avoid copying the unnecessary files and thereby copy the oversized CD onto a regular CD. (Starcraft is an example of a game protected by oversized CD). <br>
<br>
<b>Fake TOC</b>: An illegal table of contents is written to the CD, to make Windows think that the CD holds over 1 GB of data. There are commercial CD-recording programs available which can defeat this method of protection. (Tomb Raider 3 was protected with this scheme). <br>
<br>
<b>SecureROM</b>: A CD contains a file which cannot be copied by a CD burner, as well as a duplicate copy of this file which can be copied. When the program starts up, it searches for the two files and compares them. If they're not identical, then the CD must have been copied, and the program quits. Cracks to defeat this protection are available online. (FIFA '99 used this copy protection method). <br>
<br>
<b>LaserLock</b>: Uses a combination of a special CD-making process and software protection, including a special glass-mastering process and a state-of-the-art debug prevention software engineering embedded in the code. (Metro Police is an example of a game protected with LaserLock). To defeat this protection, a CD can be copied in its entirety onto the hard drive and burned onto a CD-R from the hard drive. <br>
<br>
<b>Other protection methods</b>:<br>
<br>
- SafeDisc <br>
- CD-Cops <br>
- DiscGuard <br>
<br>
<u>All of the above methods can be defeated.</u> <br>
